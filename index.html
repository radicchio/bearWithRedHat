            <p>Although Paddington now lives in London, England, he originally came from Peru where he was brought up by his
                Aunt Lucy after he was orphaned following an earthquake when he was just a few weeks old.</p>
            <p>When Aunt Lucy went to live in the Home for Retired Bears in Lima, she decided to send him to England to live.
                After teaching him to speak perfect English, Aunt Lucy arranged for him to stow away in a ship’s lifeboat.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Paddington arrived on Paddington Station in London where he was found by Mr. and Mrs. Brown. He was
                sitting on a small suitcase near the lost property office wearing nothing but an old bush hat and a label
                round his neck with the words “Please Look After This Bear. Thank You.” </p>
            <p>Unable to resist such a simple request, Mr. and Mrs. Brown took Paddington home to live with them at 32 Windsor
                Gardens in London, along with their two children, Jonathan and Judy and their housekeeper, Mrs. Bird.</p>
